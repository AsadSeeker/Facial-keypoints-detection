# Facial-keypoints-detection
Detecting human face's keypoints such as eyes,noise,mouth and so on by using CNN.<br/>
The training data 'training.csv' and The test data 'test.csv' could be downloaded on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data (Since they are too large to be uploaded).<br/>
The saved model is in 'facial data' while the main part is so large,too. So please use the training data to train the model by yourself.<br/>
AND,all the PATH in these two .py files should be rewritten if necessary when you use it.<br/>
